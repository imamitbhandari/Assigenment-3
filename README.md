Booking System Project  

 Introduction  
It is a simple Python-based Booking System Project, which I developed during my studies in the field of programming. The system is extremely user-friendly: one has to input personal information, select services (such as ferry bookings), estimate the final price and ultimately authorize or disapprove the booking. This project is not aimed at developing a professional system but to exercise the principles and concepts of basic programming that will be applicable in larger projects in future. This project was an excellent experience as a beginner to relate theory to practice. Through the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as classes and methods, I got to know how to organize the code in a better way.

This project was an excellent opportunity to relate theory with practice, as I am a beginner. I was able to understand how to organize code more effectively.

 What I Practiced  
When working on this project, I applied the following concepts:  
	Classes and Objects) I created a class which is named BookingSystem to be able to combine all the details and methods there. This made me realize how data (such as name of passengers, ID and ticket number) as well as actions (such as accepting or declaring a reservation) can be united within a single logical unit.
	Encapsulation I had many distinct functions, but I put all the methods that concerned booking in a single class. This ensures that the code is easier to maintain, and it does not cause confusion.
	User Input Handling The user is required to enter information into the program (such as ID number, service name and price). I also got to know that inputs should be checked to ensure that there are no mistakes.




 Programming Principles and Concepts  
My class BookingSystem contains the data of passengers and booking operations in a single place.  I was informed that methods conceal the complexity of what they are. As an example, the user is not required to learn how the approval reference is created, he or she is only interested in the outcome. I noticed that I used some logic several times (such as seeking input). To minimize repetition, I would like to use reusable functions in future projects.   At this point, it is not simple to add functionality to my program without modifying old code. As an example, the creation of a new type of service would require the re-writing of the code. I would like to know how to open my programs to extensions and close them to modifications.


Challenges and Things I need to Fully Understand  
- Sometimes I am confused about what class variables are and instance variables.
- I am still learning how to properly separate business logic from input/output. Right now, my code mixes them together.  
- I would like to train more regarding error handling (such as when the user types some text rather than a number).





 Reflection  

This Booking System project made me a better beginner programmer. I also got to know that programming is not that simple to write some code that works. It is also about the writing of code that is maintainable, reusable and extendable. Although this is a small project, it gave me faith and enthusiasm to create greater systems of the projects in future.

All in all, it was a small project, but it taught me big lessons about the way software is designed.
